	Go is expressive, concise, clean, and efficient.
	Its concurrency mechanisms make it easy to write programs
	that get the most out of multi-core and networked machines,
	while its novel type system enables flexible and modular
	program construction. Go compiles quickly to machine code
	yet has the convenience of garbage collection and the power
	of run-time reflection. It's a fast, statically typed,
	compiled language that feels like a dynamically typed,
	interpreted language.
